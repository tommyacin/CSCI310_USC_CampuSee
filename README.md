To run our app, you first need an API key from Google Cloud. Go to the Google
Cloud Platform console, select 'APIs and Services', then select 'Credentials', 
and create an API key. Copy this key into the appropriate location in
'app/Manifests/AndroidManifest.xml'. Also make sure to go to the API library
and enable 'Maps SDK for Android'.

Next, be sure to sync the project with the 'build.gradle'. To do this, click
'File' in the top-left corner of Android Studio and select 'Sync Project with
Gradle Files'.

Next, you need to set up an emulator for the appropriate device. We chose the
'Pixel XL API 29'.

Once everything is ready, simply click run. Once the application launches,
you're ready to go!
